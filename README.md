# 🦅 CERBERUS-AGI 2026
# Human-Like, Long-Running iOS Automation — Built for AGI Control 🧠🤖

🎬 See VIDEO.mp4 to watch CERBERUS in action✨

CERBERUS-AGI is a high-stability iOS automation framework engineered to run for months without interruption🧠

It focuses on human-like interaction, native system-level reliability, and script based/AI-driven execution🦅

Most iOS automation tools fail under long runtimes. CERBERUS solves this with TrollStore execution, a dedicated admin daemon, and a self-clean+healing architecture.

# ✨ About the Project - About Me

CERBERUS was crafted over 5+ years work. Driven by one obsession: PURE stability. 
The only way this can be achieved is to be as native as posible but still remaining truly powerful.
You can always contact me also if this is of your interest/you see it has potential/you want to hire me

# 🧱 Design Philosophy — 5 Core Pillars

Helloo, My design philosophy is built on 5 unshakeable pillars: 
> 1.  🪶 **Extreme Lightweight Efficiency** (~20MB Total App Footprint - with a preference of storing everything in the RAM - Impact on IOS Storage is minimal)
> 2.  💎 **Native Stability** (Powered by TrollStore technology as it is ultra stable + hardened with a Dopamine Admin Daemon)
> 3.  🤖 **Ultra-Intelligence** (Bridging static scripts and true AGI)
> 4.  👻 **Ghost Detection Engine** (Powered by studied humanized micro-jitter algorithms for all actions, including taps, swipes, delays etc.)
> 5.  🌳 **AutoClean/AutoHeal Engine** (AutoClean ensures no memory leaks. ALWAYS ON> 2 AutoHeal Protocols> One AutoHeal Internal Protocol and One AutoHeal External Native Shortcut Protocol)

# 🌌 Introduction — Beyond Coordinate Clicking

CERBERUS is not a simple autoclicker.
It understands screens, context, and intent, not just coordinates.

2️⃣ Automation Modes

🛠️ Manual Mode

🧠 AI Mode

# 🌉 AI Integration — Giving AI “Eyes & Hands”

CERBERUS acts as a kinetic bridge 🌉 between iOS and AI systems. With a key difference from other tools, it will do it exactly as a human.

Current Capabalities: 
> 1.  🚀 **Launch Apps**
> 2.  👁️ **Read/Interact with the screen natively (OCR) + Ability to AI to see/interact with screen content** 
> 3.  🖐️ **Tap, swipe & gesture... All actions are IDENTICAL to human behaviour**
> 4.  ⚙️ **Execute IOS Shortcuts** (Support for the native IOS Shortcuts App)
> 5.  🧱 **Run persistently in background** (No app crashes never. If it does crash, it will AutoHeal.)

And many more to come...

🌉 This effectively bridges AI reasoning models such as GPT-4o Vision, Gemini, and Claude with iOS, allowing natural language intent to be executed as real physical actions on the device.

# 👔💼 Your iPhone/iPad becomes an autonomous digital worker

💓 Potential Use Cases (Examples): 
> 1.  📈 Trader Agent AI-driven trading based on charts, news & live app data
> 2.  🎮 Game Automation. Human-like farming, healing & repetitive gameplay
> 3.  📱 Growth Engine Social workflows executed physically — not fragile APIs
> 4.  💓 Unique in helping for 0nlyFans related Marketing
> 5.  📅 Digital Secretary - Automates repetitive iOS tasks & your daily workflows
> 6.  🧠 AI Bridge - Allows AI to solve CAPTCHAs, puzzles & perform on dynamic changing UI logic

And many more to come... This are examples only — legality depends on your jurisdiction.

# 🛠️ Manual Mode / 🪄 AI Mode

CERBERUS can run 100% offline, except when using external AI APIs obviously (unless AI is local). In AI Mode, AI interprets English commands and decides optimal/logical execution paths to achieve user desired outcomes

🧠 Cognitive Offloading
Realtime screen states captured in RAM and sent to AI for decisions

🗣️ Semantic Understanding
High-level intent → precise touch automation

🩹 Self-Healing Logic
If AI fails logically, CERBERUS ensures deep-process survival & recovery

🧬 Human-Like Input Engine system-wide

# 🖐️ Human System-Wide Logic Engine

🖐️ System-Wide Logic Engine: 
> 1.  〰️ Bezier-curve swipes (non-robotic motion)
> 2.  💓 Micro-tremors during holds, taps, gestures...
> 3.  ⏳ Randomized reaction latency and delays (±12%)
> 4.  🛡️ Edge Boundary protection against off-limit system gestures
> 5.  🧬 Native Human System-Wide inputs

# ⚙️ Compatibility & Architecture - Supported Environments

📱 TrollStore + Palera1n/Dopamine (Rootless / Roothide)

🍎 iOS 15 / 16 / 17 / Will add support for Palera1n IOS 18 (IPAD 7TH GEN)

💓 iPhone & iPad are fully supported

# 🛠️ Admin Jailbreak Daemon + Cerberus TrollStore App

🛠️ Admin DAEMON Info: 
> 1.  🛡️ This means power. Full privileges. Capable of extreme assistance/recovery of CERBERUS Main App.
> 2.  🛡️ Survives crashes. Internal protection mechanism based on strict heartbeat algorthims
> 3.  🛡️ Can still work in Safe Mode + Detects & exits Safe Mode automatically
> 4.  🛡️ Can detect and solve Dopamine Watchdog Timeouts + perform userspace reboots to apply
> 5.  🛡️ Many other curated Defense Mechanisms like Auto-Refresh App Registrations without any interruption etc.

# 🧠 Core System Features
