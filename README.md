# 🦅 CERBERUS-AGI

The First "Human-Like" Automation AGI for iOS 🧠✨ You can see the VIDEO.mp4 to see it in action. Soooooo, 

**CERBERUS-AGI** was forged by me with a singular obsession: to achieve the **ultimate evolution** in iOS automation. 🚀  It can withstand months of non-stop execution. Refined with AI to improve the stability so its basically inmortal.

Helloo, I am a IOS Security Researcher & Software Designer. This project was crafted for more than 5 years and I am still improving it. The full propietary source code is for sale also as of January 2026.

You can always contact me also if this is of your interest/you see it has potential/you want to hire me

Soooooo, lets start. This project was borned because the other tools available in the market had lots of issues, at least for me. The stability was the main one.

Soooo, My design philosophy is built on 5 unshakeable pillars: 
> 1.  🪶 **Extreme Lightweight Efficiency** (~20MB Total App Footprint - with a preference of storing everything in the RAM - Impact on IOS Storage is minimal)
> 2.  💎 **Native Stability** (Powered by TrollStore technology as it is ultra stable + hardened with a Dopamine Admin Daemon)
> 3.  🤖 **Ultra-Intelligence** (Bridging static scripts and true AGI)
> 4.  👻 **Imposible Detection** (Powered by studied humanized micro-jitter algorithms for all actions, including taps, swipes, delays etc.)
> 5.  🌳 **AutoClean/AutoHeal** (AutoClean ensures no memory leaks. ALWAYS ON> 2 AutoHeal Protocols> One AutoHeal Internal Protocol and One AutoHeal External Native Shortcut Protocol)

## 🌌 INTRODUCTION> Infinite Intelligence: A New Era
**CERBERUS** transcends simple coordinate clicking. It is **not** limited to manual static scripts. 

2️⃣ There are two modes> MANUAL MODE/AGI MODE 2️⃣

CERBERUS transcends simple coordinate clicking. It is born to be integrated with AI of preference. 

CERBERUS serves as the kinetic bridge 🌉 where it has the ability to read the screen, launch apps, swipes, taps, execute shortcuts etc.. and with this it empowers specialized AI software like GPT-4o Vision/Gemini/Claude to take full control, transforming english digital intent into precise physical action. 

In other words: Your iPhone/iPad is now your own autonomous digital employee. 👔💼

💓 POTENTIAL SOFTWARE USES INCLUDE>
Here are 5 powerful ways to leverage **CERBERUS** + **AI Vision**:

1. Trader Agent 📈💸: Sleep while your bot trades based on the input sources you choose. *Money to invest/News to feed/Graphics/Whatever GPT,CLAUDE,GEMINI can do for u
2. Undetectable Game God 🎮🕹️: Farm loot, heal parties, and snipe auctions with ultra humanized inputs
3. Growth Engine 🚀📱: Manage social DMs/All Social Account Creation/0nlyFans Marketing (Normal tools do this through APIS which are fragile/temporal/unstable/shadowban/ban. CERBERUS will try to do it better and smarter, just physically, just like a human would do, it will take longer but its bulletproof).
4. The Digital Secretary 👩‍💼📅: A proactive assistant that makes IOS Ecosystem fully aware of itself to manage repetitive tasks/homework.
5. Bridge 🌉🧠: CERBERUS per se is not intelligent but where it shines is in the inter-connection. Giving the AI "eyes and hands" to read CAPTCHAs, solve screen puzzles or other complex tasks where a normal bot lacking intelligence and self-awareness will fail.

And many more, this are just examples. And in the following years as AI converts into AGI I will add more examples👻
For now> The only limit is your imagination and the legality within your jurisdiction✨

⚡MODES>
Automation workflows can be crafted manually or generated via AI Assistance with prompts and then AI takes full control🪄.
CERBERUS can still operate in OFFLINE mode without problem, however keep in mind AI obviously requires internet access unless the AI runs locally, in that case CEBERUS could run 100% Offline.


In AI Mode, the system autonomously interprets your natural English commands and decides the best pathway for execution. 
It is engineered to interconnect with GPT-4o Vision/Gemini or other that have the ability to understand IOS Ecosystem Handling

🧠 **Cognitive Offloading:** Captures realtime screen states stored in RAM and sends them to external AI APIs to make complex logical decisions 

(e.g., *"Open Classroom and do my maths homework, please ensure its done safely, do not send it, when finished please stop"* ⚔️ or *"Open TradingApp, select Demo Account, and do smart investments for 24 hours"* 🧩).


🗣️ **Semantic Understanding:** Instead of searching for exact pixels, CERBERUS was created to be more simpler than that, the framework acts on high-level instructions interpreted by VLMs (Vision Language Models), effectively turning language into precise touch automation.

🩹 **Self-Healing Properties:** LLMs are not perfect yet. CERBERUS cannot solve directly struggles that the AI could be facing in that moment, this is up to the AI. However, instead it guarantees that it will not crash and if it does crash it will AutoHeal thanks to 2 HeartBeat Protocols and design other strategies for the purpose.

## 🧬 The Best "Human-Like" Engine
Built with a proprietary **Human Logic Engine**, CERBERUS simulates organic touch variances, micro-tremors, and reaction latencies to be truly indetectable. 🕵️‍♂️

## ⚡ Compatibility & Architecture
Designed for **TrollStore**, **Dopamine Rootless**, and **Dopamine Roothide** environments on iOS 15/16. 📱For iPhone/iPad.
iPad 7th GEN is compatible with both Palera1n and IOS 18. So in this case it will work with iOS 15/16/17/18

** CERBERUS uses a unique **Admin Daemon** 🛠️ (Besides the TrollStore App this Daemon can be installed with Filza). This Daemon ensures CERBERUS full priveleges so it can run even when tweak injection was turned off due to a watchdog timeout/if Safe Mode was triggered🛡️

## 🧠 Core Features: The "AGI" Difference 

### 1. Neural Touch Engine (Humanized Input) 🖐️
Unlike traditional autoclickers that get banned for mechanical patterns 🤖, **CERBERUS** implements:

〰️ **Bezier Curve Interpolation:** Swipes follow natural, imperfect arcs, not robotic straight lines.

💓 **Micro-Tremors:** Simulates the imperceptible "hand shake" of a human finger during hold operations (`TouchSimulator.m`).

⏳ **Variable Latency:** Randomized "Reaction Time" jitter (**±12%**) to prevent temporal fingerprinting.

🛡️ **Edge Protection:** Intelligent coordinate clamping to avoid triggering unintended System Gestures (Control Center or Home Bar).

### 2. Visual Cortex (Background OCR) 👁️👁️

Powered by a highly optimized **Tesseract** engine massaged for iOS:

🚀 **20ms Latency:** Optimized C++ implementation for real-time text detection.

🎨 **Software Rendering Pipeline:** Uses `CIContext` software renderers to ensure stability in background daemons where GPU access is locked. 🔒

📐 **Hybrid Normalization:** Automatically adapts between **Pixel Space** (1080p) and **Point Space** (UIKit) for universal device compatibility. 📱

### 3. Deep System Control ⚙️
👻 **Persistent Daemon:** Runs independently of the UI. Your script continues even if the app crashes or is closed.

🌉 **IPC Bridge:** A robust file-based Inter-Process Communication allowing the App and Daemon to exchange data instantly. File-Based interconnnection of Cerberus Daemon vs Cerberus App because during testing it showed ultra perfect communication.

🔓 **True Admin:** Everything is native for perfect execution. Native app launching and hardware-level event injection. All exactly as a human.

## 🔧 Technical Specifications
### Scripting Engine 📜

CERBERUS uses a robust, proprietary scripting format designed for stability and simplicity.

This was crafted this way to ensure short scripts and to be understood by everyone. This also helps the AI to craft better scripts. 

Other tools have complex scripting which would crash any AI due to complexity/variables.

CERBERUS solves this using an internal JSON AI PARSER, so it uses its own unique and super easy commands

# 🎮 Example Manual Script. The Syntaxis

name: RealExampleScriptShowcaseV1

loop: true

loopTimes: -1

defaultDelay: 0


applaunch: com.xxxxx.xxxxxx

ocr:Login

swipe:0.5,0.8|0.5,0.2|0.5

find:BANNED|shortcuts://run-shortcut?name=BAN

tap:0.16,0.73

lock

home

volumeUp

volumeDown

ocr:Explore>delay:2

ETC...

As you can see the syntaxis must be really simple so that a AI/AGI can create decent scripts that will finish with a positive outcome. 
In the folder IMAGES/VIDEOS of this project you can see this in action📜⚡

### Resource Efficiency 🔋

📉 Dynamic Frequency Scaling: The daemon sleeps when idle (**0% CPU**) and wakes only for action execution, it tries to interfere minimally to avoid any JETSAM kills

🧹 Memory Safety: Automatic strict recycling of the OCR engine and other components to prevent heap fragmentation during 24/7 operation, to ensure months of true operation

🔋 And many other optimizations so the drainage is as minimal as possible
