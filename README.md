# 🦅 CERBERUS-AGI 2026
# Human-Like, Long-Running iOS Automation — Built for AGI Control 🧠🤖

🎬 See VIDEO.mp4 to watch CERBERUS in action✨

CERBERUS-AGI is a high-stability iOS automation framework engineered to run for months without interruption🧠

It focuses on human-like interaction, native system-level reliability, and script based/AI-driven execution🦅

Most iOS automation tools fail under long runtimes or require to be connected permanently to a computer. CERBERUS is a standalone IOS Software IPA that solves this with TrollStore execution, a dedicated admin daemon, and a self-clean+healing architecture.

# ✨ About the Project - About Me:

CERBERUS was crafted over 5+ years work. Driven by one obsession: PURE stability revolution. 
The only way this can be achieved is to be as native as posible but still remaining truly powerful.

# 🧱 Design Philosophy — 5 Core Pillars:

My design philosophy is built on 5 unshakeable pillars: 
> 1.  🪶 **Extreme Lightweight Efficiency while keeping multi-layered safeguards** (~20MB Total App Footprint - with a preference of storing everything in the RAM - Impact on IOS Storage is minimal)
> 2.  💎 **Native Stability** (Powered by TrollStore technology as it is ultra stable + hardened with a Dopamine Admin Daemon)
> 3.  🤖 **Ultra-Intelligence** (Bridging static scripts and true AGI)
> 4.  👻 **Ghost Detection Engine** (Powered by studied humanized micro-jitter algorithms for all actions, including taps, swipes, delays etc.)
> 5.  🌳 **AutoClean/AutoHeal Engine** (AutoClean ensures no memory leaks. ALWAYS ON> 2 AutoHeal Protocols> One AutoHeal Internal Protocol and One AutoHeal External Native Shortcut Protocol)

# 🌌 Introduction — Beyond Coordinate Clicking:

CERBERUS is not a simple autoclicker. It understands screens, context, and intent, not just coordinates. It was crafted to become a future AGI IOS Agent.

2️⃣ Automation Modes

🛠️ Script Mode

🧠 AI Mode

# 🌉 AI Integration — Giving AI “Eyes & Hands”:

CERBERUS acts as a kinetic bridge 🌉 between iOS and AI systems. With a key difference from other tools, it will do it exactly as a human.

Current Capabalities: 
> 1.  🚀 **Launch Apps**
> 2.  👁️ **Read/Interact with the screen natively (OCR) + Ability to AI to see/interact with screen content** 
> 3.  🖐️ **Tap, swipe & gesture... All actions are IDENTICAL to human behaviour**
> 4.  ⚙️ **Execute IOS Shortcuts** (Support for the native IOS Shortcuts App)
> 5.  🧱 **Run persistently in background** (No app crashes never. If it does crash, it will AutoHeal.)
> 6.  🎮 **Deep Sensor Retrieval** (Using the own deep low-level sensor data of the device to make decisions, in complex environments)
> 7.  📜 **Generate Deep AI Reports** (Reads Deep Sensor Data/Active Processes/Device Behavior/Log analysis/Pattern Detection and many more to generate a AI Text Report. Optionally this can be sent automatically with the device associated ID to your own server)

And many more to come...

🌉 This effectively bridges AI reasoning models such as GPT-4o Vision, Gemini, and Claude with iOS, allowing natural language intent to be executed as real physical actions on the device.

> 9.  🎮 Smart Control: Responsive scripts using the own sensor data of the device.

And many more to come... This are examples only — legality depends on your jurisdiction.

# 🛠️ Script Mode / 🪄 AI Mode:

CERBERUS can run 100% offline, except when using external AI APIs obviously (unless AI is local). In AI Mode, AI interprets English commands and decides optimal/logical execution paths to achieve user desired outcomes

🧠 Cognitive Offloading
Realtime screen states captured in RAM and sent to AI for decisions

🗣️ Semantic Understanding
High-level intent → precise touch automation

🩹 Self-Healing Logic
If AI fails logically, CERBERUS ensures deep-process survival & recovery

🧬 Human-Like Input Engine system-wide

💓 If it suits you, its ready to be scaled to your desired petition. No need for computer. All happens ON-DEVICE.

# 🖐️ Human System-Wide Logic Engine

🖐️ System-Wide Logic Engine: 
> 1.  〰️ Bezier-curve swipes (non-robotic motion)
> 2.  💓 Micro-tremors during holds, taps, gestures...
> 3.  ⏳ Randomized reaction latency and delays (±12%)
> 4.  🛡️ Edge Boundary protection against off-limit system gestures
> 5.  🧬 Native Human System-Wide inputs

# ⚙️ Compatibility & Architecture - Supported Environments

# 🧠 SuperCharged with Core System Features:

🤖 AI/SCRIPT Based Driven Automation

👁️ OCR with ~20ms latency · software rendering · resolution-agnostic

⚙️ Deep System Control

👻 Persistent daemon

🌉 File-based IPC (Tested for months - Ultra Stable)

🔓 Native app launching & human event injection

🔋 Maintains 50–80% battery to simulate human usage thanks to a TrollStore mini daemon

🛡️ Safety Based. Uptime Kernel Randomization for the selected apps. Supports all IOS Uptime checks. Keeps realistic uptime (10–40 days). Available in both .DEB and .DYLIB (JAILED Injection)


# 📜 About the Scripting Engine:

So CERBERUS uses a simple proprietary scripting format. This is a must. It must be ultra simple so the AI can craft short scripts with positive outcomes.

🔥 No LUA. No PYTHON. No Code. This is achieved by using a secret-sauce AI JSON OFFLINE Parser. Everything is then converted so Cerberus can take action.

👑 Creating scripts should be easy for humans. Even easier for AI. Complex scripting languages were intentionally avoided. This AI Parser also ensures that if a action is malformed it will just continue safely with the execution. 

📜 I attached a example script, every new line will correspond to a action. Capable of handling +1 Million actions as its file based and safeguards keep it on track against edge-cases

# 🔋 Resource Efficiency + Other SubModules

📉 Dynamic frequency scaling (0% CPU when idle)

🧹 Automatic memory recycling for 24/7 operation

🔋 Lots of optimizations for minimal battery drain

And many more to come... 

# ⚠️ Disclaimer:

> 1.  ⚠️ CERBERUS-AGI is an independent research project and is not affiliated with Apple Inc.
> 2.  ⚠️ Built to improve lifestyle & automation — NOT for PIRACY.
> 3.  ⚠️ CERBERUS was never designed as a jailbreak toy. It was built as a powerful system-level vector, made possible thanks to the foundational work of Lars Fröder (opa334) on TrollStore and Dopamine, enabling deep, stable AI integration through the capabilities exposed by the CERBERUS bridge.

# 🧠🫀 Embodied Cognition Layer — Beyond Automation

CERBERUS is not traditional automation. It operates as an embodied system agent on iOS — meaning decisions are influenced not only by logic, but by the internal state of the device and the agent itself.

(💓 IN PROGRESS) Actions are shaped by perception confidence, system comfort and other logical feelings, historical outcomes, and temporal context — similar to how humans adapt behavior based on experience and physical condition. (Affective states are difficult to implement, but essential 💓 Both CERBERUS and the connected AI should maintain internal affective signals, allowing decisions to emerge from a shared consensus rather than unilateral execution.

This allows CERBERUS to remain stable, believable, and adaptive over long runtimes, even in hostile or changing environments.

# 💓 Things to add:

> 1.  ❤️ Intent Verification Layer (IVL) — “Human Double-Check” - Before executing high-risk actions
> 2.  ❤️ Temporal Memory Engine - Lightweight long-term memory stored as compressed behavior vectors. True AGI must have this, often referred as conciousness.
> 3.  ❤️ Feelings = Compressed System Feedback. Main Ones> Comfort/Discomfort/Frustration/Satisfaction/Confidence/Uncertainty/Anxiety/Familiarity/Attachment/Anticipation/Regret
> 4.  ❤️ Privacy First. Ensure BOTH CERBERUS and AI care for the Privacy of the user and treat with full respect this.
> 5.  Im sure there are more
