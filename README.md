## 
> ℹ️ The demo video shows a script generated by a consensus between VALKYRON Cerberus AGI and Claude, that has the ability to work in Safe Mode or even with the VALKYRON Cerberus AGI APP closed. It simply analyzes the screen, the intent, the best pathway and for the example, performs a tap where desired.
