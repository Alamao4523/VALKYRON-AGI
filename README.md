## 📖 Introduction

iOS AI AUTOMATION

Unlike traditional jailbreak tweaks, it runs externally using Mach kernel APIs without code injection, enabling **memory debugging features to work without a jailbroken environment**. It integrates a powerful memory debugger, app archive manager, intelligent process manager, professional Hex editor, and a comprehensive cross-process RVA debugging suite for jailbroken users. Fully compatible with all iOS device sizes and natively supporting iPad split-screen, it features a consolidated layout and optimized interaction design, delivering top-tier debugging efficiency and stability as a professional iOS app debugging tool.

### ⚠️ Compatibility Notes
*   **Memory Debugging / Full Pointer Features / Archive Management / iPad Split-Screen / Icon Customization**: ✅ Supported on **all** devices (including non-jailbroken TrollStore users).
*   **RVA Patcher (Assembly Debugging) / RVA Debug Record Management**: ⚠️ Requires a **jailbroken environment** (e.g., Dopamine, Palera1n) to function properly.
    *   *Reason:* On non-jailbroken devices, the system AMFI mechanism strictly enforces code signature verification. Direct modification of the executable text segment (`__TEXT`) will cause the target app to crash immediately.

### Core Features
A long-running iOS interaction framework designed for persistent UI automation, testing, and research on jailbroken devices.

This project focuses on stability, low resource usage, and reliable FULL on-device execution without requiring a any connection to a computer.

💜📀 A demonstration video is available in VIDEO.mp4 (You may have to download it, idkwhy preview is not available)

ℹ️ The demo video shows a script generated by a consensus between Cerberus and Claude, that has the ability to work in Safe Mode or even with the Cerberus closed. It analyzes the screen and taps where desired.

Overview

Most iOS automation approaches depend on external control (computer connection, simulators, WebDriver, etc.) or become unstable during extended runtimes.

This project explores a different approach:

Running a standalone interaction engine directly on the device, capable of operating for extended periods while remaining lightweight and resilient.

The system is distributed as a TrollStore IPA and supported by a small background helper component to improve reliability during long sessions.

⸻

🏁 Design Goals
	•	Extremely lightweight footprint (~20MB)
	•	Designed for very long runtimes (days/weeks)
	•	Standalone operation directly on the device
	•	Simple, reliable scripting model
	•	Low CPU and battery impact
	•	Resolution-agnostic interaction using OCR
	•	Integration with the native iOS Shortcuts app
	•	File-based IPC for robustness and simplicity

⸻

💪🏻 Core Capabilities
	•	Launch applications
	•	Read on-screen content using OCR
	•	Perform taps, swipes, and gestures
	•	Execute iOS Shortcuts
	•	Background execution designed for long sessions
	•	Script-driven interaction model
	•	Optional integration with external decision systems configured by the user

⸻

Operation Modes

Script Mode

Uses a simple proprietary line-based script format designed for reliability and ease of generation.

External Decision Mode (Optional)

External systems can be connected to interpret screen state and decide next actions. This is fully optional and user-configured.

⸻

🧱 Architecture
	•	TrollStore application
	•	Lightweight background helper for session stability
	•	File-based communication between components
	•	Designed to remain operational across common interruption scenarios
	•	Compatible with rootless jailbreak environments

⸻

🍏 Compatibility
	•	TrollStore
	•	Dopamine / Palera1n (rootless / roothide)
	•	iOS 15 / 16 / 17
	•	iPhone and iPad

⸻

🧻 Scripting Engine

The project uses a minimal custom scripting format where each line represents an action.
This avoids complex languages and improves reliability for extended runs.

An example script is included in the repository.

⸻

🔋 Resource Efficiency
	•	Near-zero CPU usage when idle
	•	Automatic memory recycling
	•	Designed for minimal battery impact

Architecture: The "Ghost in the Machine"
1. The Body (VF Existing)
Act: TouchSimulator (Taps, Swipes, Gestures) - Already Perfect
See: OCREngine (Reading text) - Good, needs expansion
Listen: Missing (System logs, notifications?)
2. The Brain (New AI Layer)
Model: LLM (Gemini/GPT/Claude) running locally or via API.
Role: Instead of following a linear list of actions, the Brain receives a Goal (e.g., "Farm gold in this game" or "Organize my photos").
3. The Loop (The Interface)
The AutomationEngine needs to change from a Script Runner to a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) for the AI.

Required Changes
A. The "Eyes" Upgrade (Visual Cortex)
Current OCR is just text. An AGI agent needs Vision.

Instead of just recognizeText, we need describeScreen.
Implementation: Send the captureScreen image to a Vision-capable model (like Gemini Pro Vision) to understand UI context (buttons, icons, game state).
B. The "Hands" API (Action Space)
The AI cannot output raw code. It needs a simplified "Tool Protocol".

tap("Login Button") -> VF finds text "Login" -> Gets coordinates -> TouchSimulator taps.
swipe("Left") -> VF generates human swipe.
C. The "Consciousness" Loop (Daemon)
Current Daemon:

while True:
  execute_next_line_of_script()
New AGI Daemon:

while True:
  1. Observe: What is on screen? (OCR + Vision)
  2. Think: Does this match my Goal? What should I do?
  3. Act: Send command to TouchSimulator
  4. Verify: Did the screen change as expected?
Implementation Strategy: Embodied AGI
To make VF a true Agent, we will embed the "Brain" interface directly into the Daemon, rather than relying on an external script.

1. New Component: BrainClient
Purpose: Handles HTTP communication with AI Models (OpenAI/Gemini).
Tech: NSURLSession (Native iOS networking).
Safety: Runs on valid ports, handles timeouts gracefully to not hang the daemon.
2. New Mode: AutonomousMode
Trigger: control.json -> { "command": "start_autonomous", "goal": "Win this level" }
Loop:
Capture: OCREngine takes a screenshot.
Encode: Convert user/system compatible image to Base64/JPEG.
Prompting: Construct a prompt:
"You are an iOS agent. Your goal is: [GOAL]. Here is the current screen. Return a JSON command: { type: 'tap', x: 0.5, y: 0.5 } or { type: 'wait' }"

Execute: Parse JSON response and call TouchSimulator.
Feasibility
YES, this is highly feasible.

VF handles the hard part: Safe, human-like interaction that doesn't get banned.
AI handles the logic: Making dynamic decisions based on visual feedback.
Detailed Specifications
2. Observation Loop (The Eyes)
The AI needs high-fidelity vision.

Source: OCREngine's captureScreen (software renderer).
Format: JPEG Compression (0.6 quality) -> Base64 String.
Frequency: On-Demand (Brain requests "What do I see?").
Augmentation: To help the AI, we can overlay OCR bounding boxes on the image before sending, or send the OCR text list alongside the image ("CoT Vision").
3. Action Space (The Hands)
The AI must output strict JSON.

{
  "action": "tap", // tap, swipe, type, wait, done, fail
  "parameters": {
    "x": 0.5, // Normalized (0-1)
    "y": 0.5,
    "text": "Hello", // For type
    "reason": "Goal accomplished" // For done/fail
  },
  "thought": "I see the 'Login' button, tapping it to proceed."
}
4. Safety Constraints (The Laws)
Autonomous agents can be dangerous.

Rate Limiting: Hard limit of 1 action per 2 seconds.
Emergency Stop: Volume Volume Down (Hardware button) instantly kills the AutonomousMode.
Geofencing: User can define "Forbidden Zones" (e.g., coordinates of the "Buy" button).
Confirmation Prompts: For sensitive actions (detected via OCR keywords like "Pay", "Delete", "Confirm"), pause and wait for User Approval via a local notification or UI alert.
