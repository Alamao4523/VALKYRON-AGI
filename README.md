# 🦅 CERBERUS-AGI 2026
# Human-Like, Long-Running iOS Automation — Built for AGI Control 🧠🤖

🎬 See VIDEO.mp4 to watch CERBERUS in action✨

CERBERUS-AGI is a high-stability iOS automation framework engineered to run for months without interruption🧠

It focuses on human-like interaction, native system-level reliability, and script based/AI-driven execution🦅

Most iOS automation tools fail under long runtimes. CERBERUS solves this with TrollStore execution, a dedicated admin daemon, and a self-clean+healing architecture.

# ✨ About the Project - About Me

CERBERUS was crafted over 5+ years work. Driven by one obsession: PURE stability. 
The only way this can be achieved is to be as native as posible but still remaining truly powerful.
You can always contact me also if this is of your interest/you see it has potential/you want to hire me

# 🧱 Design Philosophy — 5 Core Pillars

Helloo, My design philosophy is built on 5 unshakeable pillars: 
> 1.  🪶 **Extreme Lightweight Efficiency** (~20MB Total App Footprint - with a preference of storing everything in the RAM - Impact on IOS Storage is minimal)
> 2.  💎 **Native Stability** (Powered by TrollStore technology as it is ultra stable + hardened with a Dopamine Admin Daemon)
> 3.  🤖 **Ultra-Intelligence** (Bridging static scripts and true AGI)
> 4.  👻 **Imposible Detection** (Powered by studied humanized micro-jitter algorithms for all actions, including taps, swipes, delays etc.)
> 5.  🌳 **AutoClean/AutoHeal** (AutoClean ensures no memory leaks. ALWAYS ON> 2 AutoHeal Protocols> One AutoHeal Internal Protocol and One AutoHeal External Native Shortcut Protocol)

# 🌌 Introduction — Beyond Coordinate Clicking

CERBERUS is not a simple autoclicker.
It understands screens, context, and intent, not just coordinates.

2️⃣ Automation Modes

🛠️ Manual Mode

🧠 AI Mode

# 🌉 AI Integration — Giving AI “Eyes & Hands”

CERBERUS acts as a kinetic bridge 🌉 between iOS and AI systems. With a key difference from other tools, it will do it exactly as a human.

Current Capabalities: 
> 1.  🚀🤖 **Launch Apps**
> 2.  👁️👁️ **Read/Interact with the screen natively (OCR) + Ability to AI to see/interact with screen content** 
> 3.  🖐️🖐️ **Tap, swipe & gesture... All actions are IDENTICAL to human behaviour**
> 4.  ⚙️🚀 **Execute IOS Shortcuts** (Support for the native IOS Shortcuts App)
> 5.  🧱💓 **Run persistently in background** (No app crashes never. If it does crash, it will AutoHeal.)

And many more to come...

🌉 This effectively bridges AI reasoning models such as GPT-4o Vision, Gemini, and Claude with iOS, allowing natural language intent to be executed as real physical actions on the device.

⚡ Automation Modes

🛠️ Manual Mode
Deterministic scripts · fully offline capable

🪄 AI Mode
AI interprets English commands and decides execution paths

📴 CERBERUS can run 100% offline, except when using external AI APIs (unless AI is local).

🧠 AI Execution Model

🧠 Cognitive Offloading
Realtime screen states captured in RAM and sent to AI for decisions

🗣️ Semantic Understanding
High-level intent → precise touch automation

🩹 Self-Healing Logic
If AI fails logically, CERBERUS ensures process survival & recovery

📜 Scripting Engine

CERBERUS uses a simple proprietary scripting format designed to be:

Easy for humans

Easy for AI

Extremely stable

Complex scripting languages were intentionally avoided.

🎮 Example Script
name: RealExampleScriptShowcaseV1
loop: true
loopTimes: -1
defaultDelay: 0
applaunch: com.xxxxx.xxxxxx
ocr:Login
swipe:0.5,0.8|0.5,0.2|0.5
find:BANNED|shortcuts://run-shortcut?name=BAN
tap:0.16,0.73
lock
home
volumeUp
volumeDown
ocr:Explore>delay:2

🔋 Resource Efficiency

📉 Dynamic frequency scaling (0% CPU when idle)
🧹 Automatic memory recycling for 24/7 operation
🔋 Optimized for minimal battery drain
